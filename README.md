# Messaging

A Moodle local plugin that handles Moodle course, course membership, group and group membership events to invoke methods on a web API. Required by [the Django vle plugin](https://github.com/INTO-University-Partnerships/django-messaging-vle) (and therefore indirectly by [the Django messaging plugin](https://github.com/INTO-University-Partnerships/django-messaging-messaging)).

One third of a trio of plugins that also includes [the Django vle plugin](https://github.com/INTO-University-Partnerships/django-messaging-vle) and [the Django messaging plugin](https://github.com/INTO-University-Partnerships/django-messaging-messaging).
